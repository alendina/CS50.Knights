# Puzzle Knights and Knaves by ML course CS50

Knights always tell the truth: if a knight asserts something, then this sentence is true. Conversely, fraudsters always lie: if a fraudster claims something, his judgment is wrong.

The essence of this task is to determine who he is - whether he is a knight or a rogue, according to what the character said (a set of sentences).
